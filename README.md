## 🙋 What is Mentored?
Mentored intends to be a single, unified platform for people new to the technology and software development to find curated, high-quality resources for their topics of interest from industry experts and real software developers. 👨‍💻

But that's not all, this platform is built to facilitate real learning with mentorship, allowing mentees to find mentors to learn skills and build up their portfolio. ✨

## 👨‍🏭 Who are we?
This project was built by [Yash Khare](https://github.com/yashk2000), [Preet Shah](https://github.com/shahpreetk) and [Ankit Maity](https://github.com/QEDK).

## 🛠️ Installation
The backend can be setup by running the following commands. You should ideally be working in a virtual environment, such as Python's `venv` or the `virtualenv` module. For the default server to work normally, you must have a PostgreSQL instance running on your `localhost` (`127.0.0.1`) on port `5432`.
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:QEDK/Mentored.git
$ cd Mentored/backend
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 manage.py runserver
  Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```
Finally, navigate to http://localhost:8000 and you should see a `Hello, world!` to signify that your app is now up and running! ⚡
